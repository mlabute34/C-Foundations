# C-Foundations
A repository dedicated to summarizing and logging my progress learning C and its foundations. 
Thanks for checking out my repo! This probably won't be particularly interesting, I'm doing this moreso for me, so that I learn C and log the fact that I'm learning it. 
I'd also like some sort of paper trail for all of my C projects, as well as any other projects I may attempt to create. A portfolio of sorts. 

In C-Foundations you'll find mostly basic, one file projects that you're free to take and do with as you please!
